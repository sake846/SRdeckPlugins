## OpenStreetMap data and standard tiles

Map data is copyright OpenStreetMap contributors and is available under the Open Database License (ODbL) 1.0. The map displays a persistent link to <https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright>.

Interactive map views request only the raster tiles needed for the current viewport from `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`. They do not implement bulk download, prefetch, or offline archives. Requests use WebView2's normal HTTP cache and an SRdeck-identifying User-Agent. The community tile service is best-effort and is governed separately from the data license; see the current [OpenStreetMap tile usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) and OSMF terms before changing this integration.

## rtl-sdr API declarations

The managed declarations in `SRdeck/SDR/RtlSdrApi.cs` correspond to the public rtl-sdr API from Osmocom. The upstream `rtl-sdr.h` is GPL-2.0-or-later and bears these notices:

- Copyright (C) 2012-2013 Steve Markgraf
- Copyright (C) 2012 Dimitri Stolnikov

SRdeck does not distribute `rtlsdr.dll`. Users obtain a compatible native library separately. The SRdeck source and combined work are distributed under GPL-3.0-only; the complete GPL-3.0 license appears in `LICENSE`. Upstream source: <https://gitea.osmocom.org/sdr/rtl-sdr>.

## SDRplay API declarations

`SRdeck/SDR/SdrPlayApi.cs` contains managed interoperability declarations for SDRplay API 3.15. SRdeck does not distribute `sdrplay_api.dll` or SDRplay's proprietary API package. Obtain the API from SDRplay and comply with its current terms, including its restriction to genuine SDRplay products. Official downloads and terms: <https://www.sdrplay.com/api/>.
